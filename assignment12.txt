Replacing <ul> (unordered list) with <ol> (ordered list) fundamentally changes how the list items are presented in a web browser.  A <ul> displays list items with bullet points (or other marker styles), indicating no particular order or sequence is implied.  Each item is equally important.  When you switch to <ol>, the browser renders the list items with numbers (or letters, Roman numerals, etc.), explicitly showing a specific order or ranking.  This suggests a sequence of steps, a prioritized list, or some other ordered relationship between the items.
